# Project: Kittens

### What's this

A fast and straightforward project to set up a Rails app to be a data-producing API completed as part of [The Odin Ruby on Rails Learning Track](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/kittens-api).

### Reflection

This was a very nice rundown practice on making a website that is both a normal HTML-producing back end AND an API. I have used the `scaffold_controller` generator to build all the 7 RESTful actions, and only after realised that *"Consider this a drill in quickly building a pure vanilla RESTful resource"* was an invitation to build all of them manually. With the scaffold generator all I need to do was only to update the views and  modify slightly `#index` and `#show` method to return the proper JSON strings. EASY PEASY!
